# Rock Paper Scissors Game 
This is a simple rock, paper, scissors game where the program will use a random number generator to pick a number between 1 and 3 to play a move. The user must also pick a number, and depending on the numbers chosen, the program will identify who the winner is. 
# Even/Odd counter 
This program will use a random number generator to create 100 integers between 1 and 100 and count how many are even or odd. To check if each number was even, the method "isEven" would check if the integer is divisible by 2, then return it to be identified.
