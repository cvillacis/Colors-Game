# Coin Tossing Game 
The main goal of the game is to reach exactly $1 and relies completely on chance. This program tosses each coin (nickel, dime, quarter) using the coin class until the total reaches or exceeds $1. A boolean method is used to determine if the given coin is heads up or down, which is then returned to add to the total. The player is given the option to replay the game as many times as they want by responding with y. 
# Fishing Game
This is a fishing game where the player can fish for random objects, each worth a certain number of points. The program will keep track of the points they earn until the player decides to stop playing. A die class is used to randomly pick what item the player will fish out. I used some video games as inspiration for the flavor text.
