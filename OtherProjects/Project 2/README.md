# Print-Strings-and-Numbers
This project applies the knowledge gained in the lab to various scenarios. The first objective is to print out information, the second manipulate strings given by the user, and the third is to create a restaurant bill with the price provided by the user.

This was my first project and introduction to Java and programming as a whole.
