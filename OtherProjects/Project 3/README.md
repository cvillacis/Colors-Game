# Numbers and Calculations
This was my second project, which collects numbers and runs calculations for three scenarios. 
1. Asks the user how many books they purchased and awards points based on their answer.
2. Asks the user how many packages were purchased. A receipt is then printed out with a discount depending on the amount purchased.
3. Calculates the speed of sound by asking the user for the distance traveled and the medium (air, water, or steel). The amount of time it will take for sound to travel is then printed.
