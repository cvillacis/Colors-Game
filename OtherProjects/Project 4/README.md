# Loops and Numbers
This project focused on making loops for two tasks. 
1. **Random Number Game**: The user must guess a number between 1-100, and the program will tell if the guess is too high or too low. The user can keep guessing until they get it right, and they will be told how many tries it took.
2. **Sum of Number**: The user must type a positive, non-zero integer and the program will add all the numbers before it then print it. (ex: enter 5: 1+2+3+4+5)
