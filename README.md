# Colors-Game
This was the final project for my introductory computer science class, where we combined all the knowledge we had learned into a single program. 
The main goal of the game is to mix/create the colors each customer wants. The first color is easy since it is given to the player with the only challenge being to mix or select the color. The second color is hidden from the player, making it much more challenging and relying purely on luck.
